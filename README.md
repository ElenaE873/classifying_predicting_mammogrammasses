# classifying_predicting_mammogrammasses
This is documentation from the final project performed from the Udemy course "Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python" (https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) on the Final Assignment on Mammogram Classification/Prediction. The assignment consisted of applying several SUPERVISED LEARNING techniques to the dataset, to determine which yielded the highest accuracy of classification, ie. predicting whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant.  The machine learning techniques applied are: Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Neural Network with Keras. i
